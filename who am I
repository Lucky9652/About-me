Karthik -  Cloud Architect
I am an accomplished  cloud architect with Projects experience. My expertise lies in cloud infrastructure management, DevOps, AIML, and business transformation, with a strong focus on AWS and Azure platforms. Since June 2021, I have been working as a freelance consultant, helping organizations migrate to the cloud, optimize their cloud infrastructure, and drive innovation through cutting-edge cloud strategies.
 I have a passion for sharing knowledge on cloud DevOps, Python, Linux, and computer networking. Whether it's guiding a startup born in the cloud or aiding a large enterprise in a cloud migration, I bring dedication and deep technical expertise to every project.

Before transitioning to freelancing, I held key roles as a Cloud Solution Architect at Microsoft India, IBM, and Amazon Internet Services Pvt. Ltd. Throughout my career, I have successfully managed high-profile clients, collaborated with C-level executives, and led cross-functional teams to develop and implement scalable, resilient, and secure cloud-native solutions.

My academic background includes an M.Tech. in Data Science and Engineering from BITS Pilani and a B.Tech. from Uttar Pradesh Technical University. I also hold a diverse array of professional certifications, including Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA), Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD), Docker Certified Associate (DCA), multiple Microsoft Azure and AWS certifications, Red Hat Certified Engineer & System Administrator, and EMC Information Storage and Management.

I am committed to continuous learning, dedicating 2 to 3 hours daily to staying updated with the latest technological advancements. My expertise with tools like Ansible, Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker, and monitoring stacks such as ELK/EFK, Grafana, and Prometheus positions me as a thought leader and trusted advisor in the cloud space.

Whether you're an individual eager to learn Cloud, DevOps, Python, Linux, Shell scripting, or Networking, or an organization looking to leverage cloud technologies for business transformation, I have the expertise and passion to guide you on your journey.
